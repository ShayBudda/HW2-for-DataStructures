This project had a few challenges for me. I won't lie Chat GPT has helped me, but I went through the code and added comments showing that I understood what was happening. The comments are fully my own. Some of the challenges I had, were that the code was a little different than what I had done before. We have sorted and done linear and binary searches on code before, but it's a little like taking the training wheels off on this one. It is interesting how you have to think outside of the box. The even and odds of the programs is a very interesting solution to a specific problem.  First you have to see if the index is even. After finding an even index in the center of the array In order to find the odd one out, you had to see if it was paired with a like element on the right of it. if it wasn't, you knew that where you are in the array was offset by the number that wasn't paired with anything. This shows that the single element was in the left side. Then the new highest index was the old middle index creating a new array that was returned to go through the process again. This kept happenning until the highest and lowest index converge and broke the while loop. That meant it had found the target integer and the final target number returned is the final low integer. Same thing happens if the target number was in the top half. You discovered it because the two numbers were the same.
